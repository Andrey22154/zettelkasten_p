# zettelkasten_p
Automated search for semantically similar notes in a personal database.
Expected format - VSCode plugin.
Zettelkasten is a method of note-taking where there is a common set of notes, each of which is associated with others through associations. Notes can be represented as a personal database and linked directly using matching.
The project idea is to automate the linking process. Find a similar note for each note and associate them after reaching a certain threshold. For working with text, a simple model like Bert may be suitable.
